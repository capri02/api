api
===
This is a simple RESTful API acts both as a server and a client. It is written in RESTIFY framework of NODE JS. RESTIFY has written on top of EXPRESS framework of NODE JS.
You can find about RESTIFY here http://mcavage.me/node-restify/
And about EXPRESS over here http://expressjs.com/

I have written this code just for learning purpose. There are more better approaches to write an API but this one is just for learning purpose.
I have no intention to give support of any kind for this code. But feel free to use it and avoid to edit this repository.
